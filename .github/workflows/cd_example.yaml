# This workflow triggers the CI, updates the version, and uploads the release to GitHub and Google Cloud Storage when a push is made to either the 'main' or 'develop' branch.
#
# Workflow Steps:
#
# 1. Ci is triggered using the CI workflow defined in .github/workflows/ci.yaml
# 2. If it succeeds, the version is updated using Python Semantic Release
# 3. The release is uploaded to GitHub (same step and GitHub action)
# 5. Authentication to Google Cloud is achieved using Workload Identity Federation
# 6. The release is uploaded to Google Cloud Storage
#
# For more details on setting up Workload Identity Federation for GitHub, visit https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setting-up-workload-identity-federation
